# Space-Invaders

## Why Space-Invaders

Space invaders is the embodyment of the Arcade Era for me (maybe galaga even more but that's way too difficult to build as first project). I like the oldschool graphics and found myself capable to create it. It brings me joy to play oldschool arcade games. If I could I would recreate them all.

### How to play

**use a/arrowkey ->** : left
**d/arrowkey <-** : right
**space**: shoot
