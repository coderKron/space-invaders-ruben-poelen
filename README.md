# Space-Invaders

Space invaders is an Arcade game created by Japanese engineer and game designer Nishikado Tomohiro in 1978 and produced by Japanese electronic game manufacturer Taito Corp. The objective of Space Invaders, which was one of the earliest video games released, is to pan across a screen and shoot descending swarms of aliens, preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen. It is viewed as a pioneer of modern gaming.

## Why Space-Invaders

Space invaders is the embodyment of the Arcade Era for me (maybe galaga even more but that's way too difficult to build as first project). I like the oldschool graphics and found myself capable to create it. It brings me joy to play oldschool arcade games. If I could I would recreate them all.
I love gaming in the modern day as well. As you can see in the copy pasted part above this header you see that Space-Invaders is a pioneer for modern day gaming.
